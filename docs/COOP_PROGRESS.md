# Co-op progress

Updated 29 October 2026. Branch: `coop`. **Estimated overall completion: 48.1%.**
The older 42% reports are historical. This percentage measures delivered and
verified behavior against the full co-op scope; it is not a running test's progress.

Six of the 39 campaign visits have combined verification evidence; 33 remain open.
The earlier contact-system repeats are still required. The remaining scope includes
full paired traversal, both scene owners, deaths and checkpoint recovery, reconnects,
shared transports, swimming/leaves and single-player regressions across the campaign.

| Area | Credited points | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Foundation and independent client diagnostics | 8 | 10 |
| Internet Host/Join | 7 | 15 |
| Two players, movement and presentation | 10.25 | 15 |
| Combat, individual resources and death | 9.25 | 20 |
| Scenes, transport and progression | 10.5 | 20 |
| Full campaign verification | 3.08 | 20 |
| **Total** | **48.08, rounded to 48.1** | **100** |

Recent verified milestones, which do not yet complete another campaign visit:

- Checkmate has separate fresh Blue-led watched-scene and Red-led skipped-scene
  internet passes, a natural team wipe and a guest reconnect pass. Other recovery
  cases remain open. Six native GPU comparisons verify both skins' weapon effects;
  real clients also receive both players' weapon effect types.
- Funhouse's return corridor, steps 35-42, passes 16 personal arrivals and 1,175
  matching player/world/native states, including Red's exact ten-second revival
  at 25 health and each player's own essence pickups.
- Funhouse machinery, steps 46-88, passes 50 personal arrivals, 11 paired holds,
  seven switch shots and 3,633 matching states. Steps 89-94 have separate scoped
  arrival, hold and pickup evidence.

Latest milestone: Funhouse steps **95-103** now have 12 verified personal arrivals,
five personal essence pickups and 1,139 matching player/world/native network states.
Both finish at 100 health, without deaths. The test uses ordinary counterbalancing,
actual native brush-support checks and visibility-aware resident enemy checks.

Latest upper-exit milestone: both players now pass steps **103-109** on source
`88b98f0`, with 12 personal arrivals, two 200-tick holds, two own pickups and
719 matching player/world/native states. A separate resumed **107-117** run
passes 22 personal arrivals, six own pickups and 1,524 matching states, without
new deaths. These are separate checkpoint segments, not a fresh full route.

Source `94488e1`, verifies the narrow descent **111-116**, including
12 personal arrivals, one actual forward waiting move, three own pickups and
1,010 matching states. Red dies naturally and revives after exactly 1,200 active
ticks at 25 health, with safe placement, preserved resources and verified camera
handoff/return. The co-op recovery logger now uses the actual slope-aware placement
rules; its old flat-ground test falsely rejected supported sloped revivals.

The waypoint-117 stall is resolved in the test controller: it now finishes a
nearby clear, supported approach within the existing walking height and arrival
bounds. A separate **116-121** prefix has six personal arrivals, three safe
waiting handoffs, one own pickup and 422 matching states, ending at 100/65 health.

Source `c8f333c` then verifies **121-125**: ten personal arrivals, five safe waiting
handoffs, two own pickups and **1,033 matching states**, ending at 90/30 health
with no deaths. The dodge controller now predicts network delay and braking;
the earlier version could walk the guest off the ledge before taking damage.

A further **121-125** replay passes with **1,079 matching states**, ten personal
arrivals, five safe waiting handoffs and two own pickups. Both finish at 70 health
without deaths. Normal checkpoints before 125 and 126 are retained, allowing
the next crossing test to resume without repeating the earlier fights.

Current blocker: at **126**, the leading player waits in the only supported
approach lane. The other stops at the required 36-unit player separation. The
next work must coordinate this narrow bank and the following pendulum crossings.
Full traversal, later scenes and exit remain open. Overall stays **48.1%**.

Tests run as two independent clients through the public network path on Anode,
with injected delay and jitter. Routine diagnosis uses state and log assertions.
Screenshots are not needed for each run. The current source also has 873 passing
active Rust tests and native Funhouse battle, machinery and scene checks; those
component results do not prove a full campaign route.

See the [fixed weighting and detailed history](COOP.md#delivery-and-verification-weighting),
[campaign matrix](COOP_CAMPAIGN.md) and [Funhouse evidence](FUNHOUSE.md). Future
updates should state the overall percentage, the new bounded milestone, and the
next unresolved acceptance check even when the percentage does not change.
